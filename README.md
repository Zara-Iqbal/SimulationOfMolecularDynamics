# SimulationOfMolecularDynamics

Molecular Dynamics has been used for many decades now to understand the temperature and pressure 
dependencies of dynamical concept in liquids, solids, and liquid-solid interfaces. MD simulation techniques 
are also well matched for understanding surface phenomena, as they give a qualitative understanding of 
surface structure and dynamics. This Project uses MD methods to better comprehend surface disorder and 
pre melting. 
Generally, it examines the temperature dependence of structure and vibration dynamics at surfaces of 
facecentered cubic (FCC) metals-mostly Ag, Cu, and Ni. It also makes exchange with results from other 
theoretical and experimental approaches. While the importance in this Project is on metal surfaces, the MD 
technique has been applied to a wide variety of surfaces with those of semiconductors, insulators, alloys, 
glasses, and simple or binary liquids. A full review of the pros and cons of the technique as verified to these 
very exciting systems is ahead the range of this Project. 
However, it is important pointing out that the success of the classical MD simulation depends on the 
accuracy with which the forces acting on the ion cores can be determined. On semiconductor and insulator 
surfaces, the success of molecular dynamics simulations has made them more appropriate for such designs 
rather than standard MD simulations. 
We can apply MD Simulation on thousands of atoms with computer and we can find out the structure of an 
atom built on its contact with other atom. This paper tells us about GROMACS one of the applications of 
MD particularly designed for proteins the effect of this research lead us to a fact that each protein has 
different long time. From Gromacs we can understand foldings and unfoldings of proteins. 
Huge scale molecular dynamics applications and keeping their success in mind we can see large scale 
simulation playing an always increasing role in future. Mutual simulation and experiments are helping to 
bond the gap between atomic level properties and whole cell behavior, an endeavor which cannot be done by 
either of the tactic alone. 

MD simulation can deliver the awareness of protein ligand interaction. It demonstrates that free binding 
energy of membrane proteins should be computed in its natural environment. Binding constants give 
information of atomistic properties and functionality of proteins and at the same time are also helpful for 
Drug transposition.
